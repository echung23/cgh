repo of R materials used for Center for Global Health
I've attached the code for the Social Networks Analysis project, CUGH Satellite Session Study, and the Literature Review. These RMarkdown files help generate the descriptive tables used in publications - they're usually used as reference because I can't upload code output directly into Google Docs, but the some of the code made the published graphics (aka Alluvial Plots)!
